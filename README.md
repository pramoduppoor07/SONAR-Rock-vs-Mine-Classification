# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Classification
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify objects detected by SONAR as either rocks or mines based on reflected signal data. The dataset contains 60 sonar signal features per instance, and the model learns to distinguish between natural underwater formations and potential threats like mines.
